**SDG Goal 12: Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns**.****


**OBJECTIVES:**

Establishing an efficient waste management infrastructure that offers affordable disposal options for individuals and businesses, thus reducing the financial burden associated with waste management.
Implementing flexible payment schemes tailored to the needs and financial capabilities of users, ensuring that waste management services remain accessible and affordable for all.
Developing a user-friendly online platform that facilitates transparent communication and collaboration between waste producers and recycling companies, promoting mutual understanding and cooperation to optimize waste management processes and benefits for both parties.


**DESCRIPTION:**

The initiative strives to pioneer a waste management platform that redefines convenience, sustainability, and incentives. Our innovative tech start-up offers a comprehensive solution catering to diverse needs, whether you're a homeowner, a bustling restaurant, or a dedicated recycling company. Here's how it unfolds: Upon registration, users receive customized disposal bins tailored to their waste types, equipped with smart sensors to signal when full, streamlining the collection process seamlessly. The highlight? As we gather waste, we collaborate with specialized recycling partners, who not only compensate for recycled materials but also allocate a portion of the revenue back to our users as rewards. This symbiotic approach ensures everyone benefits - users are incentivized for their recycling efforts, the environment reaps the rewards of reduced waste, and collectively, we advance towards a cleaner, greener future.
